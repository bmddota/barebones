# Barebones Dota 2 Addon
The best way to get started with creating Dota 2 custom games.

###Forked from [BMD's Barebones](https://github.com/bmddota/barebones). Changes to date include:
* Changed all the indentation to use tabs. Fixed up the indentation in KV files.
* Added a bunch of utility functions.
* Added basic flash stuff.
* Added stats collection.

---
###TODO:
* Always looking to add more useful utility functions.
